## Smart Stick for Blind 
- The proposed Smart Stick consists of flame sensor, ultrasonic sensor, heart rate sensor.
- Flame Sensor: When a flame is detected within a certain distance as required by the user to recognize an obstacle, a buzzer sounds to alert the visually impaired to the danger.
- Ultrasonic Sensor: When an obstacle is detected within a certain distance as the user needs to recognize the obstacle, it vibrates and sends a message to the visually impaired that there is an obstacle.
- Heart Rate Sensor: The heart rate sensor attached to the handle receives the user's heart rate and periodically sends data to the guardian, and sends the data to the web (ThingSpeak) via WiFi.
    * ThingSpeak: It is possible to check heart rate statistics by sending a value to a site that provides a visualization platform. (url: https://thingspeak.com/channels/218510/private_show)
- Application: By creating an application through Bluetooth communication, it notifies the guardian of the disabled of danger (flame detection, heartbeat, etc.).
